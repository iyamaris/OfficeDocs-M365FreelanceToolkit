Internal communication & awareness
======================================

Communications site 
--------------------

What if you could direct your employees to one place where they can get started
in under an hour? A place where questions regarding topics like confidentiality,
intellectual property, and how to get started are answered? Where employees can
see past projects their colleagues have done?

![The internal Microsoft Gig Economy site](media/M365_Freelance_GigEconomySite_Screenshot_800x450.png)

For Julie, a director leading two-cutting edge wearables in the smart product
suite, this place enabled her to get up and running in a matter of hours. She
initially was weary about confidentiality and exposing intellectual property,
but through compliance training, FAQ’s, and seeing past freelance projects from
her colleagues, she posted her first job and hired a five-star freelancer one of
her colleagues had used within two days. With the freelancer designing an
internal review deck that visually communicated features, market research, sales
forecasts, and big data opportunities, she wowed her upper management to the
point of securing funding for her project!

Challenge in the enterprise
---------------------------

One of the major challenges of launching a freelancer program in the enterprise
is driving awareness amongst internal stakeholders and adopters. People have
questions from the basics of how to get started through to education and sharing
of best practices.

The [Sharepoint Communication
Site](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-sharepoint-communication-site-94a33429-e580-45c3-a090-5512a8070732)
is a template intranet website that is designed to be your employees
one-stop-shop for everything they need to know about the program. While the site
is completely customizable by you based on your requirements, policies, and
practices, we’ve included many of our best practices in the template, such as:
