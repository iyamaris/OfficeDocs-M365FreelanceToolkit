Workflow automation case study 
===================

Liane is a Freelance Program Manager at Microsoft. While her title is technically 3 words, her responsibilities span across at least 3 different roles, with success being measured by her ability to increase internal adoption of freelance platforms. To accomplish this, her role starts looking more like the Constitution than a job description. She must:

- Be a one-woman CRM
-- Email people that sign up 
-- Email people that take training video
-- Email people that fill out application
-- Track the funnel and follow up with those at all stages 

- Be a one-woman fire department
-- Consult those with questions
-- Consult those angry about the organization using freelancers
-- Teach employees how to use freelancers, everything from job posting to freelancer management

- Operationalize the program

The results are consistently phenomenal. Not only can full time employees tap into the top 3% of talent on the platform, but this talent is delivered faster and cheaper than traditional alternatives. But getting there requires significant cognitive load. Reid Hoffman describes starting a company as, “throwing yourself off the cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down”. While difficult, he describes change in an enterprise as not throwing yourself off a cliff, but rather piloting an old 747 with every light & noise alerting your doomed to crash. Liane knows this all too well. 

Change in an enterprise is tough. Especially when that change is as prominent as implementing a new model of work. On a daily day she has problems like Sarah, who took the training video and filled out the application, but setup a profile on the platform before the system was ready. Liane has to mediate Sarah, while working with talent management platforms to mediate their back end processes as the scale of an enterprise breaks their systems. 

Or Julie, an angry employee who took the training video and filled out the application two weeks ago but never received an email. Or Ron, who doesn’t want to give public feedback after his freelancer went rogue for two weeks and delivered poor quality work. Or Sherry, whose freelancer billed 270 hours in 2 weeks. After mediating Sherry, then communicating with the talent management platform, Liane found out that the freelancer was working on three different projects under one contract. His hours were valid. He had three different freelancers working under him. But that wasn’t communicated internally or by the talent management platform.  

Liane needs a change, and that change comes from her friend Susie, a PM on the Microsoft Flow team. Flow automates workflows using if this, then that, logic between various applications. With the help of Susie, Liane identified key workflows to save her time. These were: 

- From project applications in Forms to an email follow up in Outlook 
- From compliance training videos in Microsoft Stream to an email follow up in Outlook
- From newsletter signups on SharePoint to a signup database on Excel 

Thanks to Flow, Liane no longer is a manual CRM system. Her cognitive load was significantly reduced, and she was able to focus on user engagement and retention rather than staying afloat.
