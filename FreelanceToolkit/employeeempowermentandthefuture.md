Employee Empowerment and The Future
===================================

We believe that we can uniquely empower our employees and create meaningful
economic opportunities for freelancers by enabling more seamless connections
between them.

We have firsthand experience of watching employees as they go from a genuine
fear of freelancers replacing their job, to recognition of how much more
enjoyable their work is by being able to offload the tasks that they least enjoy
through to becoming promoters of the program as their interactions with
freelancers help them learn new skills and become significantly more productive.

We see the future Enterprise as being a combination of full-time-employees and
contingent staff, where contingent staff will increasingly include the use of
freelancers and gig economy platforms. As you start your own gig economy journey
you’ll quickly come to the realization that it’s not a panacea, it’s not
applicable in many scenarios and it’s very hard to use freelancers in many
places – but in the areas where it is applicable and can be applied it becomes a
unique and powerful multiplier.
